# The _propertea_ Project

Welcome! You've landed on the git repository for our _CZ2006 (Software Engineering)_ project.  We're proud to bring you our first foray into web programming with Python! :fire::fire:

This project tries to bring you a comprehensive view of any residential property in Singapore, by bringing together data from various government sources and private sources.

Essentially, we ***spill the tea*** on these properties :wink::wink:

Feel free to look around and enjoy our amazing work :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

Our project consists of these sub-applications:
* `Home`
* `Search`
* `Listing`
* `PropertyInformation`
* `LoginManagement`
